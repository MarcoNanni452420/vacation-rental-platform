Apartment is located in a very lively, niche neighborhood, late night bars/restaurants etc., but having food and drink easily accessible was great. Recycling on street was early morning, but that is found anywhere in the city. <br/>Apartment interior was eclectic and fun. Great storage for hanging clothes. Will definitely stay again.",

Non potrei essere più ossessionato da questa proprietà rispetto a tutti i posti in cui sono mai stato. È stato un posto così incredibile dove trovare riposo dopo le intense giornate di esplorazione delle rovine affascinanti e affollate di Roma. Molto chic. L'armadio merita un post tutto suo. Era enorme e ben organizzato per nascondere i bagagli.<br/>Questa proprietà si trova nel cuore di una zona vivace, quindi c'è così tanto da fare proprio fuori dalla porta, ma questo significa anche che può essere rumoroso di notte. I miei figli, di 9 e 13 anni, usavano il rumore bianco dal loro iPad e riuscivano a dormire bene. Le mattine e i giorni erano tranquilli e incantevoli. <br/>Abbiamo tutti amato questa proprietà, l'host si prende davvero cura e si vanta di uno spazio così unico e speciale. Resteremo solo qui nei nostri futuri viaggi. Grazie mille all'adorabile host reattivo. È stato un viaggio da sogno per noi, non sarebbe stato lo stesso senza un posto così accogliente e lussuoso.",
            "originalComments": "This property is glorious! Absolutely pristine. Every detail met 10/10 from cleanliness to design to function. I could not be more obsessed with this property out of all the places I have  ever traveled. It was such a incredible place to find reprieve from the busy days exploring the beautiful and busy ruins of Rome. Very chic. The closet deserves a post of its own. It was huge and laid out beautifully to hide luggage.<br/>This property is in the heart of a hoping area so there is so much to do at your door step-this also makes for it to be noisy at night. My kids, 9 and 13, used white noise from their ipad and were able to sleep fine. Mornings and days were peaceful and lovely. <br/>We all loved this property, the host really takes pride and care of such a unique special space. We will only ever stay here on our future visits. Thank you so much to the lovely responsive host. It was a dream trip for us, it would not have been the same without such a place to feel like home and also luxurious.",

Le istruzioni su come accedere all'unità erano molto chiare e il nostro host, Riccardo, è stato estremamente reattivo e disponibile per qualsiasi domanda avessimo. Se sei sensibile al rumore, sappi che questa unità si trova proprio nel cuore del quartiere della vita notturna, tuttavia era esattamente ciò che io e i miei amici cercavamo, quindi eravamo contenti di essere così vicini a tutti i bar e feste. Mi piacerebbe assolutamente tornare a soggiornare qui la prossima volta che veniamo a Roma e consiglierei vivamente questo posto a chiunque venga qui!",

Instructions on how to access the unit were very clear and our host, Riccardo, was extremely responsive and helpful with any questions we had. If you’re sensitive to noise, be advised that this unit is located right at the heart of the nightlife district, however it was exactly what my friends and I were looking for so we were glad to be so close to all the bars and parties. I would absolutely love to stay here again next time we come to Rome and would highly recommend this place to anyone coming here!",

Clean, spacious— everything is as in the photo.<br/>The main advantage: you opened the door and you were already in the midst of Roman life! Bars, restaurants, atmosphere — everything is right on the doorstep. At the same time, all the main attractions (Colosseum, Pantheon, etc.) are within easy walking distance.<br/>An ideal base for those who want to be in the center of events and walk. 10/10, I recommend it!",
